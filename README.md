# AIPlayGround

This is a side project that I am working on. This project is a project where I will program multiple AI's and have them battle each other.

The goal is to have one AI per team that is a Commander who makes decisions based on the enemy forces and commands his force to take appropriate action. The soldiers will also make decisions for themselves,for instance try help nearby allies, and possibly also surrender to their own fear.

At the moment the project is in its early stages. At the moment I have setup a basic GameObject Component system and added pathfinding. Currently the project can handle 1000+ GameObjects wandering around with path requests. I used The SFML frame work to handle the rendering and windows.

Possible Future Considerations:
* Networking using unix sockets
* Customizing the commander AI to fight the way you want it
